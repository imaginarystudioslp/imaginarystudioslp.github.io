						<p style="text-align:justify"><i>

						<p><font color="black"><b>Akia: </b></font>What is it?</p>
						<p><font color="black"><b>Thunderman: </b></font>I saw those rifts before! No, I will make sure that that weapon is in a dead universe.</p>

						<p><font color="black"><b>Thunderman: </b></font>Dimensional spear, the most powerful weapon. Someone has it!</p>

						<p><font color="black"><b>Thunderman: </b></font>Wait! We cannot stop him like this! We need a plan.</p>
						<p><font color="black"><b>Stretch: </b></font>Here is a plan, you and Akia run, jump in one of those rifts and find help. I will slow him.</p>

						<p style="text-align:justify"><i>
						Akia with her magic powers pushed Thunderman in one rift, he falls down on the ground, his costume was torn.

						<p><font color="black"><b>Overkill: </b></font>God dammit, kid! Just go!</p>
						
						<p style="text-align:justify"><i>
						Ricky took the ship and fly away. A mysterious person came out of the rift.

						<p><font color="black"><b>Lizard: </b></font>What happened?</p>
						<p><font color="black"><b>Elizabeth: </b></font>To be honest, I thought it was something connected to you.</p>

						<p><font color="black"><b>Lizard: </b></font>I am not going!</p>
						<p><font color="black"><b>Elizabeth: </b></font>Idiot! Go! I will call others for help.</p>
						<p><font color="black"><b>Professor: </b></font>That is brilliant idea dear! Someone has to keep this people save, I can’t bring everyone on this dangerous mission.</p>

						<p><font color="black"><b>Professor: </b></font>Oh, no! I am too late! Well, what can you do? I cannot save all of them now!</p>
						
						<p style="text-align:justify"><i>
						In one room, there are Lizard, Quad, Overkill, Silverfang and Professor. 
						Thunderman is lying on the bed.
						</i></p>
						
						<p><font color="black"><b>Professor: </b></font>You are all wondering why you are here?</p>
						<p><font color="black"><b>Lizard: </b></font>No man, you told as that we need to save multiverse, that’s why we are here. </p>
						<p><font color="black"><b>Professor: </b></font>Indeed. </p>
						<p><font color="black"><b>Quad: </b></font>We know why we are here, but why us?</p>
						<p><font color="black"><b>Professor: </b></font>I’m afraid that collapse came early in other dimensions, you are what I can find.</p>
						<p><font color="black"><b>Overkill: </b></font>So, we are the last option? </p>
						<p><font color="black"><b>Lizard: </b></font>But, why us?  They are other people in our dimensions!</p>
						
						<p><font color="black"><b>Professor: </b></font>Quad and Overkill stopped the second war, Silverfang defeated a lot of knights and 
																		monsters, Lizard saved so many people and bring them home and this fellow on couch, 
																		he neglected his life to help others. 
																		</p>
																		
						<p><font color="black"><b>Silverfang: </b></font>And he is dead now!</p>
						<p><font color="black"><b>Professor: </b></font>He is not dead! </p>
						<p><font color="black"><b>Lizard: </b></font>He looks dead to me. </p>
						<p><font color="black"><b>Quad: </b></font>Hey Overkill! He has a mask, he is your colleague. </p>
						<p><font color="black"><b>Professor: </b></font>Silence! We don’t have time for joking! </p>
						<p><font color="black"><b>Thunderman: </b></font>Where am I? Noooo! Akia!</p>
						<p><font color="black"><b>Professor: </b></font>Calm down boy! If you want to save your girlfriend, you will have to restore peace to the multiverse first. </p>
						<p><font color="black"><b>Thunderman: </b></font>She is not my girlfriend!</p>
						<p><font color="black"><b>Quad: </b></font>Oh great! We are in team with teen!  I thought, Ricky is hard to work with. </p>
						<p><font color="black"><b>Professor: </b></font>You should not talk like that with team leader!</p>
						<p><font color="black"><b>Thunderman: </b></font>Wait, I am team leader?</p>
						<p><font color="black"><b>Professor: </b></font>Of course you are! You started all of this!</p>
						<p><font color="black"><b>Thunderman: </b></font>I have my own team, I am not…</p>
						<p><font color="black"><b>Professor: </b></font>Don’t make this thing harder, you are leader!</p>
						<p><font color="black"><b>Overkill: </b></font>Hey! Chill! No one will listen to you anyway.</p>
						<p><font color="black"><b>Quad: </b></font>You're scared of the competition, Overkill?</p>
						<p><font color="black"><b>Thunderman: </b></font>What we can do?</p>
						<p><font color="black"><b>Silverfang: </b></font>The kingdoms were destroyed. I watched people die! The magic is dead! There is nothing that can be done!</p>
						
						<p><font color="black"><b>Professor: </b></font>Not in every Earth! 
																		I will tell you a story. 
																		Back in the days, there was only one dimension, Earth Prime. 
																		I don’t why it has that name when it is entire universe. 
																		Anyways, Takija, name of dragon that you fought, was an immortal 
																		being who served and helped people. The world was perfect, 
																		without violence, deception and evil, but Takija was bored. 
																		He wanted to create new worlds to protect. He managed to do it, 
																		he created a multiverse, but, it had a price. His dimension was the 
																		source of energy for creating a multiverse. No one knows how many dimensions 
																		he created. When he returned back, his dimension died and portal was closed. 
																		For centuries, he lived alone in his dimension, knowing that he killed his world. 
																		</p>
																		
						<p><font color="black"><b>Silverfang: </b></font>How did he find the way to leave Earth prime and to do this?</p>
						
						<p><font color="black"><b>Thunderman: </b></font>There were seven powerful weapons. One of them was dimensional spear. 
																		 To stop our enemies to use it, me and my friends open a portal and send weapon to 
																		 that Earth, thinking that no one is there no one that can use it. 
																		 </p>
																		 
						<p><font color="black"><b>Lizard: </b></font>You were wrong! </p>
						<p><font color="black"><b>Professor: </b></font>Well, it’s not his fault. The spear did not go there. </p>
						<p><font color="black"><b>Thunderman: </b></font>What?!</p>
						<p><font color="black"><b>Professor: </b></font>I mean… Yes, but only one part!  Takija had to make rest of it, which is why spear was unstable. </p>
						<p><font color="black"><b>Quad: </b></font>I know what you're trying to say. We need to find the rest of the spear!</p>
						<p><font color="black"><b>Professor: </b></font>Exactly!</p>
						
						<p style="text-align:justify"><i>
						The communicator on the table was activated.
