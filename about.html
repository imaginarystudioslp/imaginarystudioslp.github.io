          <p><b>Founder</b></p>
          <p align="justify">
            Lazar created ImaginaryStudios way back before it was a website or even a team. It was the place where he wrote stories and let his imagination run wild.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            John Diaz, One shot, and Victor are just small teasers of bigger stories he wrote in addition to many others. 
            Horokos and Professor is a comic he always wanted to do with George Ive. 
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Next to ImaginaryStudios he was doing co-writing for Celestial Guardian and editing for Anonymous comic book industries.

          <p><b>Co-founder</b></p>
          <p align="justify">
            George was the first one to join the team. He immediately created the current version of the website and edited it himself.
            He works daily on editing and improving the website. 
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            George had the idea for the Horokos character, and with Lazar, he went through several versions of the story until they decided on the final one 
            and created the Horokos and Professor comic book series. He is the co-creator and editor of that comic.

          <p>V13 recently joined the team.</p>
          <p align="justify">
            She is a traditional artist, helping with sketching and putting character designs on paper. 
            She also has a sketchbook with her characters and design that will maybe appear in our universe sooner or later.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            V13 went to 'Kardas art' art school, where some of her artworks ended up in a children's coloring book. 
            She also worked on house models. The small monument she made with her colleagues from school is in a park in her hometown.
